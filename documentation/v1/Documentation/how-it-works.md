# How it works

##### *documentation about the documentation...*ðŸ¤¯

The documentation is created using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This is a static site generator that uses React and Markdown. The documentation is written in Markdown, and the pages are created using React components.

The documentation is split into two parts: the API and the frontend. The API is written in PHP, and the frontend is written in React. The documentation is split into two parts to make it easier to understand the codebase.

## Authors

The library used is by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) and this documentation is created by [Tom Shaw](https://github.com/tomshaw650).
