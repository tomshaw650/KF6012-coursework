# Welcome to my KF6012 Docs!

Use the sidebar to navigate to the different parts of the documentation.

## API

The API is built in Object Oriented PHP designed as endpoints for use in a web application.

This project interfaces the API with a React frontend, however it is language-agnostic.

## Frontend

The frontend is built in React with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), using the [React Router library](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to handle navigation.

## Documentation

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator.

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```
