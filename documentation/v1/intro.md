# Welcome to my KF6012 Docs!

Use the sidebar to navigate to the different parts of the documentation.

## API

The API is built in Object Oriented PHP designed as endpoints for use in a web application.

This project interfaces the API with a React frontend, however it is language-agnostic.

## Frontend

The frontend is built in React with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), using the [React Router library](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to handle navigation.

## Documentation

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator.


## EXAMPLE MARKDOWN STUFF (TO DELETE)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes 

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
