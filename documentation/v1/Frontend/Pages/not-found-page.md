# NotFoundPage.js

## Summary

NotFoundPage is a component that displays an error message and a button to return to the previous page. The route is any route that is not set within the `App.js` and the page can be found [here](http://unn-w19025481.newnumyspace.co.uk/kf6012/coursework/app/404)

## How it works

The page pulls in components to set a header and navigation bar. `ContentInfo` component provides an error message, and a back button is visible, using the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom`. Finally, the footer is displayed at the bottom of the page.
