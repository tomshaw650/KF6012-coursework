# configIcon.js

## Overview

This web application uses the `react-icons` library to display icons. This is a function to add styling to wrapped icons. It uses `{ Icon Context }` from `react-icons` to add styling to the icons.

## How it works

The `children` are wrapped in a `<IconContext.Provider>` with a value of `"size: 2em"`. This automatically resizes any icon wrapped within `<ConfigIcon>`.
